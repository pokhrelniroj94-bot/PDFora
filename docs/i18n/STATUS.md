# PDFora i18n rollout: status

Branch: `i18n/global-multilingual` (from `feat/pdf-ora-ai-help-market-signals` @ 8cf31b8). Not merged, not deployed.

## Execution limits (verified in this sandbox)
- `npm ci` / `next build` / lint / tsc: BLOCKED. npm crashes and the egress proxy answers 403 for registry.npmjs.org. Nothing has been built or tested; no result below is a PASS.
- Existing `npm run verify:tools` FAILS on this branch before any i18n change: "Homepage is not using the canonical tool directory" (scripts/verify-tool-catalog.mjs:87). The homepage moved to `components/HomePageClient.tsx` while the script reads `app/page.tsx`. Needs a reviewed fix; the test was not edited or removed.

## Inventory (static parse, see inventory.json)
- Page routes 63, API routes 6, catalog entries 125 (10 categories), 49 legacy root-level PDF slugs.
- Hand-written blog slugs: 8 (blog-posts.ts) + 19 (nepal-blog-posts.ts); tool-guides.ts adds posts at runtime (count to confirm at build time).
- Branch-specific features to preserve: NEPSE market/research/lab, forex, news APIs, AI writing (`/api/ai-writing`, Upstash + Cloudflare rate limiting), SiteAIHelp, SmartToolCenter, MarketIntelligence.

## Status table

## Verification log (only things actually executed)
Local run by the project owner on Windows, commit 2131ace (output reviewed):
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm ci` | PASS (366 packages; 8 moderate audit findings, pre-existing, for Phase 8) |
| `npm run verify:tools` | PASS |
| `npm run i18n:test` | PASS 13/13 |
| `npm run i18n:check` | PASS (English valid; 9 locales unpublished) |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | PASS (no output) |
| `npm run build` | PASS (Next 16.4.3 Turbopack; `/[locale]` dynamic, `/ne` static, existing routes intact) |
| `npm run lint` | FAIL: 2 errors, 3 warnings. 2 in LanguageSwitcher.tsx were caused by this work (fixed afterwards, see below); 3 are pre-existing in NepalLiveTools.tsx (error), NepseAlphaLab.tsx and SiteAIHelp.tsx (warnings) |

After the lint fix (authoring sandbox only; lint/tsc/build must be re-run locally):
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `verify:tools`, `i18n:test` (14 tests), `i18n:check` | PASS |
| `lint`, `tsc`, `build` of the fix | NOT RUN |

Not yet tested by anyone: runtime behavior of /ar, /de etc. in preview mode, 404 without preview, /en redirect, switcher keyboard use.

## Phase 2 lint cleanup (commit follows 43b98f3)
Pre-existing findings fixed with minimal edits, no behavior change:
- NepalLiveTools.tsx:175 `today's` -> `today&apos;s` (renders identically).
- NepseAlphaLab.tsx: removed `result`/`setResult` state that was only ever set to null and never read (displayed results come from the `metrics` useMemo).
- SiteAIHelp.tsx: effect deps `[pathname]` -> `[pathname, pagePath]`; pagePath is derived from pathname, so run timing is unchanged.
Authoring sandbox re-ran verify:tools, i18n:test (14/14), i18n:check: PASS. lint/tsc/build: NOT RUN here; pending owner's local run.
